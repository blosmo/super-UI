 *  - `lib/base-context.tsx` (decides whether the right-panel "Primitive"
 *    toggle should affect the install URL on a given doc page)
 *
 * Adding a new dual-flavour component: append its slug here and that's it.

 * needs no manifest; tests/registry-consistency.test.mjs keeps it equal to
 * the set the postbuild derives from registry.json.
